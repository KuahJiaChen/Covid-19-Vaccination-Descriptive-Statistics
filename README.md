# Covid 19 Vaccination Descriptive Statistics

## About 
The objective of this assignment is to investigate and visualize data given using Python and several Python libraries. There are three datasets given, which are "Vaccination.csv", "2019-GDP.csv", and "2020-Population.csv". Hence, I would be using these datasets to perform data wrangling, feature engineering, and data visualization. Eventually, a data frame that contains the information of population, total vaccinations, people fully vaccinated, GDP, and GDP per capita for 11 South East Asia Countries would be produced. The outline given in the beginning part of the notebook shows the major steps of this submission. Subsequently, the data frame would be used to provide some statistical description. At last, several plots would be constructed using the data in the data frame as an assist to answer a few questions.

## Dataset
* "Vaccination.csv" -  contains information about the progress of Covid-19 vaccinations around the world. (source: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-worldvaccination-progress). All the descriptions of the columns are on the Kaggle site.
* “2019-GDP.csv” - contains the recorded Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of almost all countries in the world for the year 2019. (source: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/gdp-ranking).
* “2020-Population.csv” - contains information about country and region population from 1950 to 2020. (source: https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/)
