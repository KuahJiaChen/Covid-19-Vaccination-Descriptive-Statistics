# Covid 19 Vaccination Descriptive Statistics

Author: Kuah Jia Chen

## About 
The purpose of this assignment is to utilize Python and various Python libraries to investigate and visualize data. The assignment includes three datasets: "Vaccination.csv," "2019-GDP.csv," and "2020-Population.csv." These datasets will be used for data wrangling, feature engineering, and data visualization. The main objective is to create a data frame containing information on population, total vaccinations, people fully vaccinated, GDP, and GDP per capita for 11 South East Asian countries. The notebook provides an outline outlining the major steps of this project. Subsequently, the data frame will be analyzed to obtain statistical descriptions. Finally, several plots will be generated using the data frame to address specific questions.
